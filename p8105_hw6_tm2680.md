``` r
hom_balt_df = 
  hom_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

fit_log = 
  hom_balt_df %>% 
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = ., family = binomial())

fit_log %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         lower_bound = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error),
         upper_bound = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error)) %>% 
  select(term, OR, lower_bound, upper_bound)
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 x 4
    ##   term              OR lower_bound upper_bound
    ##   <chr>          <dbl>       <dbl>       <dbl>
    ## 1 (Intercept)    3.27        2.07        5.19 
    ## 2 victim_age     0.993       0.987       0.999
    ## 3 victim_sexMale 0.412       0.315       0.537
    ## 4 victim_race    0.441       0.313       0.620

The adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing non-white to white victims, keeping all other variables fixed, is 0.4406. We are 95% confident the true value for this OR lies between 0.3129 and 0.6204.
