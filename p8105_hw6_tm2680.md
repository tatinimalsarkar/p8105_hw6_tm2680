fit_log %>%

  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         lower_bound = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error),
         upper_bound = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error)) %>%

```

    ## # A tibble: 4 x 4

The adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing non-white to white victims, keeping all other variables fixed, is 0.4406. We are 95% confident the true value for this OR lies between 0.3129 and 0.6204.

``` r
glm_func = function(df) {
  log = glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = df, family = binomial())
  
  broom::tidy(log) %>% 
    mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         lower_bound = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error),
         upper_bound = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error)) %>% 
    filter(term == "victim_race") %>% 
    select(OR, lower_bound, upper_bound)
}
```

``` r
hom_df_glm = hom_df %>% 
  nest(resolved, victim_age, victim_sex, victim_race) %>% 
  mutate(models = map(data, glm_func)) %>% 
  unnest(models) %>% 
  select(-data)
```

``` r
hom_df_glm %>% 
  mutate(city_state = forcats::fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_bound, ymax = upper_bound), width = 0.2) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  labs(title = "Solving homicides for non-white vs. white victims",
         x = "City",
         y = "OR")
```

![](p8105_hw6_tm2680_files/figure-markdown_github/hom_glm_plot-1.png)

This plot depicts the odds ratio of solving a homicide for a non-white victim compared to a white victim. In cities like Boston, the odds of solving a murder for a non-white victim is 0.118 times the odds of solving a murder for a white victim. We're 95% confident the true value for this OR would lie between 0.049 and 0.285. Because this range doesn't include the null OR value of 1, resolving a homicide and victim race are significantly associated. In other words, in a city like Boston, white victims are likelier to have their case solved. The reverse might hold true in a city like Tampa, where the estimated OR is 1.159. However, because the 95% confidence interval ranges from 0.587 to 2.288, race and resolving a homicide might not be associated.

Problem 2
=========

``` r
bw_df = read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(babysex = as.factor(babysex),
         frace = as.factor(frace),
         mrace = as.factor(mrace),
         missing = sum(is.na(babysex:wtgain)))
```

To build this model, I first narrowed my focus to maternal factors that might influence child birthweight, including pre-pregnancy weight (`ppwt`) and maternal height (`mheight`). I hypothesized that as maternal height and weight increased, so too would the child's weight.

First, I tried linear models including each predictor variable individually.

``` r
# Fit of mother's height alone
fit_mrace = lm(bwt ~ mheight, data = bw_df)
summary(fit_mrace)
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = bwt ~ mheight, data = bw_df)
    ## 
    ## Residuals:

``` r
# Fit of mother's weight alone
fit_fincome = lm(bwt ~ ppwt, data = bw_df)
summary(fit_fincome)
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = bwt ~ ppwt, data = bw_df)
    ## 
    ## Residuals:
    ##      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max

    ## F-statistic: 150.2 on 1 and 4340 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16

Both seemed important, so I tested whether adding maternal race to family income as predictors made a difference, using ANOVA.

``` r
fit_null = lm(bwt ~ ppwt, data = bw_df)
fit_alt = lm(bwt ~ ppwt + mheight, data = bw_df)

anova(fit_null, fit_alt) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable(digit = 3)
```

    ## Warning: Unknown or uninitialised column: 'term'.

|-------:|-----------:|----:|---------:|----------:|--------:|

The combination seemed useful. Finally, I wanted to see if maternal smoking modified the effect of maternal height and pre-pregnancy weight.

``` r
bw_df %>% 
  lm(bwt ~ ppwt * smoken + mheight * smoken, data = .) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term           |  estimate|  std.error|  statistic|  p.value|
|:---------------|---------:|----------:|----------:|--------:|
| (Intercept)    |  1140.416|    208.911|      5.459|    0.000|
| ppwt           |     3.220|      0.491|      6.556|    0.000|
| smoken         |   -48.269|     26.211|     -1.842|    0.066|
| mheight        |    25.232|      3.595|      7.018|    0.000|
| ppwt:smoken    |    -0.013|      0.054|     -0.238|    0.812|
| smoken:mheight |     0.684|      0.445|      1.538|    0.124|

Smoking doesn't seem to add anything to our model, so my final model included `ppwt` and `mheight`. But I wanted to check whether a linear model would make the most sense.
